Inversion Velocity Analysis Code in 1D/2D

This is a pythonified version of the Code I wrote during my PhD thesis (full Fortran 90). The most computer-expensive part will remain in Fortran and I need to make all f2py, python, mpi work together...
Work in progress...

The code should implement the theory exposed in (Chauris and Cocher, 2017) and (Cocher et al., 2017).

More details to come...
